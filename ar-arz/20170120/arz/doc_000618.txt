كتب لوموند المائة للقرن

كتب المائة للقرن
20th century, drawn up in the spring of 1999 through a poll conducted by the French retailer and the Paris newspaper لوموند.

Starting from a preliminary list of 200 titles created by bookshops and journalists, 17,000 French voted by responding to the question, "Which books have stayed in your memory?" ( « Quels livres sont restés dans votre mémoire ? »).

The list of acclaimed titles mixes great novels with poetry and theatre, as well as the comic strip. The first fifty works on the list were the subject of an essay by Frédéric Beigbeder, "The Last Inventory Before Liquidation", in which he notably drew attention to its character.
